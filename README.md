# tracker-fob

Tracking fobs were short-range sensors used by bounty hunters to track their quarries. Bounty hunters who take on assignments gain access to their target's chain codeâ€”an identification marker that describes certain biographical information. This code drives the parameters of tracking fobs, which are attuned to this biometric data.

Upon the capture and delivery of said quarry, a Guild operative runs a sensor check on the bounty's body and compares it to the chain code data on the fob, confirming the identification of the acquisition.

In 9 ABY, the Bounty Hunters' Guild handed out tracking fobs to its hunters. Quarries listed on tracking fobs througout their history included a Mythrol, Grogu, and Fennec Shand, all of whom were collected by Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin.
